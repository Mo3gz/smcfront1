### ‚ú® Core Features

This application is built for both participants (Team Members) and event organizers (Administrators), offering a rich set of features to make the competition engaging and manageable.

#### **Team Member Features**

  * **Live Scoreboard**: A real-time leader board that displays team rankings, scores, and currency (Kaizen) in an engaging format, with live visual cues for updates.
  * **Dynamic Inventory**: A personal inventory system for collecting and using various "cards" earned through the game. Cards have unique effects categorized as:
      * **Attack Cards**: Impact other teams' scores or resources.
      * **Alliance Cards**: Facilitate collaboration and score boosts with other teams.
      * **Luck Cards**: Offer personal advantages or special actions.

      * **Lucky Spin** for instant currency and gifts.
